        "\n# Low-Memory Dropout\n\nIn this tutorial, you will write a memory-efficient implementation of dropout whose state\nwill be composed of a single int32 seed. This differs from more traditional implementations of dropout,\nwhose state is generally composed of a bit mask tensor of the same shape as the input.\n\nIn doing so, you will learn about:\n\n* The limitations of naive implementations of Dropout with PyTorch.\n\n* Parallel pseudo-random number generation in Triton.\n"

        "## Baseline\n\nThe *dropout* operator was first introduced in [SRIVASTAVA2014]_ as a way to improve the performance\nof deep neural networks in low-data regime (i.e. regularization).\n\nIt takes a vector as input and produces a vector of the same shape as output. Each scalar in the\noutput has a probability $p$ of being changed to zero and otherwise it is copied from the input.\nThis forces the network to perform well even when only $1 - p$ scalars from the input are available.\n\nAt evaluation time we want to use the full power of the network so we set $p=0$. Naively this would\nincrease the norm of the output (which can be a bad thing, e.g. it can lead to artificial decrease\nin the output softmax temperature). To prevent this we multiply the output by $\\frac{1}{1 - p}$, which\nkeeps the norm consistent regardless of the dropout probability.\n\nLet's first take a look at the baseline implementation.\n\n"

        "## Seeded dropout\n\nThe above implementation of dropout works fine, but it can be a bit awkward to deal with. Firstly\nwe need to store the dropout mask for backpropagation. Secondly, dropout state management can get\nvery tricky when using recompute/checkpointing (e.g. see all the notes about `preserve_rng_state` in\nhttps://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html). In this tutorial we'll describe an alternative implementation\nthat (1) has a smaller memory footprint; (2) requires less data movement; and (3) simplifies the management\nof persisting randomness across multiple invocations of the kernel.\n\nPseudo-random number generation in Triton is simple! In this tutorial we will use the\n:code:`triton.language.rand` function which generates a block of uniformly distributed :code:`float32`\nvalues in [0, 1), given a seed and a block of :code:`int32` offsets. But if you need it, Triton also provides\nother `random number generation strategies<Random Number Generation>`.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Triton's implementation of PRNG is based on the Philox algorithm (described on [SALMON2011]_).</p></div>\n\nLet's put it all together.\n\n"
